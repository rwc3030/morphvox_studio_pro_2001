# Issues to Address

1. Milestone: Voice Transformation Enhancement
2. Epic: Voice Processing Improvements
3. Feature: Feature Completion
4. User Story: 
5. Acceptance Criteria:
   - Review the generated code for logical flow.
   - Check for edge cases that may not be handled.
   - Ensure functional integrity of the code.
   - Document any identified issues in this section.

## Identified Issues:
- The `VoiceTransformer` class does not handle cases where the input buffer contains NaN (Not a Number) values, which could lead to undefined behavior during audio processing.
- The `applyTransformation` method should include additional validation for the `formantShift` parameter to ensure it does not exceed a certain threshold, which could distort the output.
- The UI component does not provide feedback for invalid parameter values, which may confuse users.

*Note: The feature has not been marked as complete.*
