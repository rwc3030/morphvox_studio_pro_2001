# Issues to Address

1. Milestone: Voice Transformation Enhancement
2. Epic: Voice Processing Improvements
3. Feature: Feature Completion
4. User Story: 
5. Acceptance Criteria:
   - Review the generated code for logical flow.
   - Check for edge cases that may not be handled.
   - Ensure functional integrity of the code.
   - Document any identified issues in this section.

## Identified Issues:
- All identified issues have been resolved, including handling NaN values in the input buffer and validating the formantShift parameter.
- Edge Case Handling: No handling for negative values in the input buffer.
- Parameter Validation: No upper limit check for pitchShift in applyTransformation.
- Voice Character Handling: No validation for character parameter in applyVoiceCharacter.
- **New Issue**: The code does not handle cases where the input buffer contains values outside the expected range for audio samples.

*Note: The feature has not been marked as complete.*
