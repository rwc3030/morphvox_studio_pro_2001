# Issues to Address

1. Milestone: 
2. Epic: 
3. Feature: Feature Completion
4. User Story: 
5. Acceptance Criteria:
   - Review the generated code for logical flow.
   - Check for edge cases that may not be handled.
   - Ensure functional integrity of the code.
   - Document any identified issues in this section.

## Identified Issues:
- The `VoiceTransformer` class in `FeatureImplementation.cpp` does not handle cases where the input buffer is null or the number of samples is zero, which could lead to crashes or undefined behavior.
- The `applyTransformation` method should include checks for valid parameter values retrieved from `ParameterManager` to avoid unexpected results during audio processing.

*Note: All issues have been recorded, and the feature is not marked as complete.*
