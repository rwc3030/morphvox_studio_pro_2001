# Issues to Address

1. Milestone: Voice Transformation Enhancement
2. Epic: Voice Processing Improvements
3. Feature: Feature Completion
4. User Story: 
5. Acceptance Criteria:
   - Review the generated code for logical flow.
   - Check for edge cases that may not be handled.
   - Ensure functional integrity of the code.
   - Document any identified issues in this section.

## Identified Issues:
- Logical flow is coherent, but additional comments are needed for clarity in complex sections.
- Edge cases related to extreme parameter values (e.g., very high or low pitch shifts) have not been fully tested.
- Functional integrity is mostly intact, but some functions lack unit tests.
- **New Issue:** The handling of audio processing when parameters are set to extreme values (e.g., pitch shift of 0 or negative values) needs to be explicitly defined to avoid unexpected behavior.

*Note: All issues have been recorded, and the feature is not marked as complete.*
