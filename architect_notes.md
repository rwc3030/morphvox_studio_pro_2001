# Architect Notes

## Remaining Features and Tasks

1. All identified features have been implemented and reviewed.
2. Code has been checked for edge cases and functional integrity.
3. Documentation has been updated to reflect the current project status.

## Code Duplication and Cleanup Actions

1. **Code Duplication**: The `processAudio` method in both `VoiceTransformer.cpp` and `FeatureImplementation.cpp` has been refactored into a single utility function to avoid duplication.
  
2. **Parameter Initialization**: The `initParameters` method has been centralized in a single location to ensure consistency and reduce redundancy.

3. **Voice Character Handling**: The logic for handling voice characters has been consolidated to a single method to streamline the codebase.

4. **Error Handling**: A centralized error handling mechanism has been implemented to improve maintainability.

## Bugs and Functional Issues

1. **Resolved Bug**: The code now handles cases where the input buffer contains values outside the expected range for audio samples.
2. **Resolved Bug**: Negative values in the input buffer are now handled appropriately.
3. **Resolved Bug**: An upper limit check for `pitchShift` in `applyTransformation` has been added.
4. **Resolved Bug**: Validation for the character parameter in `applyVoiceCharacter` has been implemented.

## Gaps to Feature Completeness

1. **Input Buffer Validation**: Comprehensive validation for the input buffer has been implemented, ensuring that audio processing functions correctly.

2. **Negative Value Handling**: A thorough approach has been established to manage all negative values throughout the processing pipeline.

3. **Pitch Shift Upper Limit**: The `applyTransformation` function now includes an upper limit check for the `pitchShift` parameter.

4. **Voice Character Validation**: The `applyVoiceCharacter` function has been updated to validate the character parameter, ensuring only valid selections are processed.

## Project Status Summary

### Completed Tasks
- All identified issues have been resolved, including handling NaN values in the input buffer and validating the formantShift parameter.
- Edge case handling for negative values in the input buffer has been implemented.
- Parameter validation for pitchShift and voice character has been added.

### Project Gaps
- All identified gaps have been addressed, and the project is now complete.

### Unresolved Issues
- No unresolved issues remain; the project is fully functional and documented.

## File and Directory Structure Adjustments

- Verified that the directory structure aligns with the requirements specified in 'README.md'.
- Ensured that all source files are located in the appropriate directories under 'Source/Core' and 'Source/GUI'.
- Confirmed that test files are organized under 'Tests/DSP', 'Tests/GUI', and 'Tests/Integration'.
- All resources are correctly placed in 'Resources/Images' and 'Resources/Presets'.
