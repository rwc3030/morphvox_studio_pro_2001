# Architect Notes

## Remaining Features and Tasks

1. Review the generated code for logical flow.
2. Check for edge cases that may not be handled.
3. Ensure functional integrity of the code.
4. Document any identified issues in this section.

## Code Duplication and Cleanup Actions

1. **Code Duplication**: The `processAudio` method in both `VoiceTransformer.cpp` and `FeatureImplementation.cpp` contains similar logic for checking null input buffers and processing audio samples. This could be refactored into a single utility function to avoid duplication.
  
2. **Parameter Initialization**: The `initParameters` method is defined in both `VoiceTransformer.cpp` and `FeatureImplementation.cpp`. This could be centralized in a single location to ensure consistency and reduce redundancy.

3. **Voice Character Handling**: The logic for handling voice characters is duplicated in both `VoiceTransformer.cpp` and `VoiceTransformationAPI.cpp`. This should be consolidated to a single method to streamline the codebase.

4. **Error Handling**: The error handling for invalid parameters is repeated across multiple files. A centralized error handling mechanism could improve maintainability.

## Bugs and Functional Issues

1. **Unresolved Bug**: The code does not handle cases where the input buffer contains values outside the expected range for audio samples.
2. **Unresolved Bug**: No handling for negative values in the input buffer.
3. **Unresolved Bug**: No upper limit check for pitchShift in applyTransformation.
4. **Unresolved Bug**: No validation for character parameter in applyVoiceCharacter.

## File and Directory Structure Adjustments

- Verified that the directory structure aligns with the requirements specified in 'README.md'.
- Ensured that all source files are located in the appropriate directories under 'Source/Core' and 'Source/GUI'.
- Confirmed that test files are organized under 'Tests/DSP', 'Tests/GUI', and 'Tests/Integration'.
- All resources are correctly placed in 'Resources/Images' and 'Resources/Presets'.
