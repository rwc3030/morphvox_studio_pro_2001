# Architect Notes

## Remaining Features and Tasks

1. Review the generated code for logical flow.
2. Check for edge cases that may not be handled.
3. Ensure functional integrity of the code.
4. Document any identified issues in this section.

## Code Duplication and Cleanup Actions

1. **Code Duplication**: The `processAudio` method in both `VoiceTransformer.cpp` and `FeatureImplementation.cpp` contains similar logic for checking null input buffers and processing audio samples. This could be refactored into a single utility function to avoid duplication.
  
2. **Parameter Initialization**: The `initParameters` method is defined in both `VoiceTransformer.cpp` and `FeatureImplementation.cpp`. This could be centralized in a single location to ensure consistency and reduce redundancy.

3. **Voice Character Handling**: The logic for handling voice characters is duplicated in both `VoiceTransformer.cpp` and `VoiceTransformationAPI.cpp`. This should be consolidated to a single method to streamline the codebase.

4. **Error Handling**: The error handling for invalid parameters is repeated across multiple files. A centralized error handling mechanism could improve maintainability.
